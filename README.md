## Hi, I’m Csenge 👋

I’m a computer science student at **42 Madrid**, currently building a strong foundation in programming through project-based learning, with a focus on **C**, **problem-solving**, and **low-level systems concepts**.

Before transitioning into software development, I trained and worked in **veterinary medicine** and other responsibility-heavy roles. That background shaped how I approach problems today: with precision, structured thinking, and attention to detail—especially in regulated or high-stakes environments.

### 🧠 What I’m working on
- Core C projects from the 42 curriculum
- Algorithmic thinking and debugging
- Unix/Linux tools, Git, and collaborative workflows
- Writing clear, maintainable code and documentation

### 🔍 What you’ll find here
This GitHub contains my **42 Madrid projects**, completed as part of the school’s peer-to-peer, self-driven curriculum.  
Each project reflects my learning process, problem-solving approach, and growing understanding of software fundamentals.

### 🌍 Background
- Doctor of Veterinary Medicine (University of Veterinary Medicine Budapest)
- Experience in international and multilingual environments
- Comfortable working independently and within teams
- Languages: **Hungarian (native)**, **English (fluent)**, **Spanish (B2)**

### 🚀 Looking ahead
I’m actively developing my skills in software development and looking to grow in a **collaborative, learning-focused environment**, where I can continue building solid technical foundations and contribute thoughtfully to a team.
